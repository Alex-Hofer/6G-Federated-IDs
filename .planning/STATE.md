# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** Detect DDoS attacks across a federated network of edge nodes without any client ever sharing its raw network traffic data.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Project Foundation and Data Pipeline

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Project Foundation and Data Pipeline)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase (complete)
Status: Executing Phase 1
Last activity: 2026-03-09 -- Plan 01-02 executed

Progress: [███████░░░] 67%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 9min
- Total execution time: 0.3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 2 | 17min | 9min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (12min), 01-02 (5min)
- Trend: accelerating

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5-phase linear dependency chain (Data -> Model -> FL -> Eval -> Integration) based on research finding that 7/10 pitfalls originate in data layer
- [Roadmap]: INFR-01 and INFR-02 placed in Phase 1 (not a separate phase) since config and reproducibility are foundational cross-cutting concerns
- [Roadmap]: DATA-04 mapped to both Phase 1 (weight computation) and Phase 2 (weighted loss in training loop) -- primary assignment Phase 1, consumed in Phase 2
- [Roadmap]: EVAL-01 (per-round console metrics) placed in Phase 3 (FL Infrastructure) rather than Phase 4 because per-round logging is integral to FL training, not post-hoc evaluation
- [01-01]: EnvYamlLoader subclass of SafeLoader to avoid global YAML loader mutation (Pitfall 7)
- [01-01]: Anchored .gitignore patterns (/data/, /outputs/) to avoid ignoring src/federated_ids/data/
- [01-01]: Config validation checks both top-level sections and required nested keys with descriptive error messages
- [01-02]: Domain shortlist of 44 DDoS-relevant features with fallback to all numeric columns if fewer than target remain
- [01-02]: Near-constant filter at >99% same value threshold in addition to zero-variance filter
- [01-02]: Correlation filtering keeps the feature with higher variance from each correlated pair
- [01-02]: Class weights saved as JSON (portable) alongside scaler saved as joblib pkl

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: CICIDS2017 download URL needs verification -- multiple mirrors exist with different file sets (flagged by research)
- [Phase 3]: Flower API version (1.x classic vs 2.x) must be confirmed during Phase 1 dependency pinning (flagged by research)
